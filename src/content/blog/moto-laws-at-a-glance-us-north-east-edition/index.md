Sometimes you wonder what the rules are around motorcycle helmets, licenses, etc.
You can look them up around the web, but you can also find them here.
At least, if you live in the United States.

Since the U.S. is so large, I'm breaking down the states into regions.
This first post will cover the North East United States.
Find your state, or one you'll be riding through, below to quickly check out the local moto laws.

**Key**

- {{< figure src="icon-helmet.svg" width="40px" class="inline" >}} helmet law
- {{< figure src="icon-lane.svg" width="40px" class="inline" >}} lane splitting/filtering law
- {{< figure src="icon-license.svg" width="40px" class="inline" >}} minimum age to get a license
- {{< figure src="icon-inspection.svg" width="40px" class="inline" >}} frequency of a state inspection, if required
- {{< figure src="icon-insurance.svg" width="40px" class="inline" >}} if insurance is required
- *- -* means there isn't a law

*If this series has any traction, I'll cover other countries once the U.S. is complete.*
