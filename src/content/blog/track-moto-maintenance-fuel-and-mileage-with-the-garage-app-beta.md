I've been working on a web app for motorcycle owners like us for awhile now.
Since I got my first motorcycle I had an itch to do basic maintenance myself.
I knew that in order to keep my warranty I needed a way to keep track of everything.
Once I got my second bike this need became even more important.

I got to work creating a web app to track these services, logs, etc.
Now there is [R// Garage](/garage/).
I know there are alternatives out there and for now, this app doesn't match them feature for feature, but I see a great future ahead.
Now I need help testing it and getting feedback in order to make it better and more useful for all of us.

## Why join the private beta?

Today opens the private beta for R// Garage and I would love for you to [request access](/garage/beta/).
Here's why:

- you can keep track of your bikes and maintenance in one app
- available in any browser, no worries on losing that notebook with your logs
- it's free
- with your help, we can make the app get better
