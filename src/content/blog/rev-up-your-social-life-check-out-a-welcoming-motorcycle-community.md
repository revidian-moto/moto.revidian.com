[Bikers.Social](https://bikers.social) is a free social network powered by [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).
If you don't know, Mastodon is a social media platform, kind of like Twitter, but different.
Instead of one big company running everything, it's like a bunch of smaller "towns" connected together.
Each town can have its own rules and vibe, and you can choose which ones you want to hang out in.

In that context, Bikers.Social is an online "town" with riders from around the world sharing motorcycle related content with each other.
In their own words, it is:

> A place for the motorcycle community! No matter what you ride, if it has two wheels and an engine you are welcome.
>
> We'd love to fill the local timeline with bikers, bikes, and their adventures together.


## What you'll see on the site

You'll find motorcycle related content;
Conversations about specific bikes, adventures that various users go on, pictures and more.
You can see some of the latest posts happening via the [live feed](https://app.bikers.social/public/local).
Revidian Moto joined the site a few weeks ago.
You can find our account [here](https://app.bikers.social/@RevidianMoto).


## Joining Bikers.Social

Signing up is quick so [get started](https://app.bikers.social/auth/sign_up).

### What if I'm already on Mastodon:question:

That's okay.
That still gives you three options:

1. **Create a second account** It can be helpful to create multiple social media accounts to separate your interests. Your old high school friends and your Grandma might not want to hear about your latest ride through the twisties but your future friends on Bikers.Social would. :smile:
1. **Move your account** If you're intent on having just one account but prefer a motorcycle centric server, you can [migrate your account](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/).
1. **Follow some Bikers.Social accounts** Honestly, you don't really need to create a new account at all. You'll miss out on a few benefits but this is the easiest option. Find accounts on the [live feed](https://app.bikers.social/public/local) that look interesting and give them a follow from your server.

Hopefully we'll see you on there.
