Welcome to a new website on the Internet, Revidian Moto.
It's a brand that will be providing motorcycle content, software, and eventually products and services.
The initial focus will be on motorcycles in the American market because that's where I have the most knowledge.
As we go, and depending on the audience, we'll cast a wider net.

Why did I create this and what's next?

## Why Create Revidian Moto?

Have you ever been at the parts counter at Auto Zone and they flip around the monitor to show you their stock and you're greeted by an operating system that looks 20 years old?

~~Have you ever~~ how many times have you been in a dealership or other shop and aren't sure if you're being lied to just for an upsell?

Revidian Moto is created for everyone who like us, have answered yes to these questions.
I'm aiming to inject modern technology and authenticity into the industry and everything we do.
